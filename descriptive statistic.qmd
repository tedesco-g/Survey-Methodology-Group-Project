### Â´**Missing Data Imputation**

```{r}


#numeric variables
summary(final_data)

```

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(naniar)

# Visualize missing values
gg_miss_var(final_data) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Missing Data Patterns")

```

In this analysis, we examined the missing data patterns in my dataset to assess data completeness and identify potential issues. The visualization helped determine which variables contain missing values and to what extent. While some variables were fully observed, others had significant gaps, requiring appropriate handling strategies.

```{r}



# Ensure final_data is a data frame
final_data <- as.data.frame(final_data)

# only variables with missing data for imputation
impute_vars <- final_data %>% select(`preprim_exp`, `prim_exp`, `lose_exp`, `upse_exp`, `voc_exp`)


# Generate a predictor matrix
predictorMatrix <- make.predictorMatrix(impute_vars)


 

imputed_data <- mice(impute_vars, method = "mean", m = 5, maxit = 10, seed = 123)


# Replace missing values with the first imputed dataset
final_data <- final_data %>%
  mutate(
    preprim_exp = complete(imputed_data, 1)$preprim_exp,
    prim_exp = complete(imputed_data, 1)$prim_exp,
    lose_exp = complete(imputed_data, 1)$lose_exp,
    upse_exp = complete(imputed_data, 1)$upse_exp,
    voc_exp = complete(imputed_data, 1)$voc_exp
  )

# Check if imputation worked correctly
summary(final_data$voc_exp)
summary(final_data$preprim_exp)
summary(final_data$prim_exp)
summary(final_data$lose_exp)
summary(final_data$upse_exp)


```

In this analysis, we handled missing data using mean imputation with the MICE package. This method replaces missing values with the average of observed values for each variable, preventing data loss while maintaining consistency. We focused on five education expenditure variables (preprim_exp, prim_exp, lose_exp, upse_exp, voc_exp), ensuring they no longer contain missing values.

After imputation, the summary statistics confirmed that all variables now have complete data, with reasonable mean and range values. However, since mean imputation can reduce variability, we need to check whether the data distribution has been affected. Notably, voc_exp has a minimum value of 0, unlike other variables with higher minimums, suggesting a different distribution pattern.

Overall, our imputation process successfully addressed missing data, making the dataset more reliable for further analysis. To ensure the imputed values align well with the data structure, we recommend additional visual checks, such as histograms or density plots.

```{r}


# Visualize missing values
gg_miss_var(final_data) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "After Imputation, Missing Data Patterns")


```

The visualization confirms that after performing mean imputation, all missing values in the dataset have been successfully handled. The vertical bar at zero missing values indicates that no variables contain missing data anymore. This means our imputation process effectively filled in all gaps, making the dataset complete and ready for further analysis.

Age-Education Distribution Analysis

This variable categorizes individuals based on the age at which they completed full-time education. The dataset contains two versions: an **11-category classification** and a **simplified 5-category grouping**.

In the **detailed 11-category version**, respondents are categorized from **"Up to 14 years" (1) to "22 years and older" (9)**, alongside **"Still studying" (10)** and **"No full-time education" (11)**. The most common completion ages are **15 years (2) and 16 years (3)**, suggesting that a significant proportion of individuals exit full-time education during their teenage years. In contrast, fewer respondents remain in school past the age of 21.

The **simplified 5-category classification** merges some of these distinctions, grouping individuals as:\
- **"Up to 15 years" (1):** Those who left school by age 15.\
- **"16-19 years" (2):** Individuals who completed education in their late teens.\
- **"20 years and older" (3):** Those pursuing education beyond 19.\
- **"Still studying" (4):** Respondents currently in full-time education.\
- **"No full-time education" (5):** Individuals who never attended full-time education.

Across both classifications, the data highlights that **most individuals leave full-time education at 15 or 16 years old**, with fewer continuing beyond that. The presence of a **"Still studying"** category indicates an active student population, but the relatively low frequencies in higher education categories suggest that **early school leaving is prevalent**.

These findings offer insights into **educational attainment trends** and could be useful for **policymakers looking to improve retention in higher education**.

Additionally, The skin color variable helps categorize individuals based on whether they identify as a minority in terms of skin color. This distinction is crucial in understanding social dynamics, as it can provide insights into experiences of discrimination, representation, and equality within different groups.

The dataset includes two main categories. The first category (**0 - Not mentioned**) represents individuals who do not identify as part of a racial or ethnic minority based on their skin color. The second category (**1 - A minority in terms of skin color**) includes individuals who perceive themselves as belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group due to their skin tone.

The distribution of responses shows that the vast majority of individuals fall into the "Not mentioned" category, meaning they do not consider themselves as part of a skin color minority. In contrast, a much smaller proportion of respondents identify as belonging to a racial minority.

This finding suggests that racial or ethnic minorities based on skin color constitute a relatively small fraction of the dataset. Understanding this demographic breakdown is essential when examining disparities in economic opportunities, access to education, or social integration. Additionally, this variable can be used to investigate potential discrimination or differences in social perception based on racial identity.

```{r}
 information_plot

```

The graph illustrates respondents' opinions on whether schools should provide education about diversity concerning intersex individuals, sexual orientation, and transgender identity. The response categories range from "Totally agree" (1) to "Totally disagree" (4), with an additional category for "Don't know" (5).

The results indicate that the majority of respondents either "Totally agree" (1) or "Tend to agree" (2) that schools should inform students about diversity in these areas. The highest agreement is observed across all three categories, suggesting broad support for diversity education. However, a notable proportion of respondents "Tend to disagree" (3) or "Totally disagree" (4), reflecting some resistance to integrating these topics into school curricula. Overall, the findings suggest that while most people recognize the importance of diversity education, there are still opposing views that indicate societal divisions on this issue.

```{r}
voice_plot
```

The graph represents perceptions of voice representation in two contexts: at the European level ("European Voice") and at the national level ("Native Voice"). The responses are categorized into levels of agreement, ranging from "Totally agree" (1) to "Totally disagree" (4), with additional categories for refusals and unknown responses.

The data suggests that a significant portion of respondents "Tend to agree" (2) that their voice is heard both in their country and in the EU, making it the most common response. However, there are also notable groups that "Tend to disagree" (3) or "Totally disagree" (4), indicating skepticism about their influence in political or social discussions. The distribution is relatively similar for both European and national contexts, suggesting that perceptions of representation do not differ drastically between these two levels.

```{r}
identity_plot
```

The dataset analysis highlights how many people identify as religious or ethnic minorities. The graphs show that most individuals do not consider themselves part of these groups. In particular, only a small number identify as part of a religious minority, and the same goes for those who declare a Roma identity.

```{r}
gender_bar
```

According to the results, 54.7% of the respondents are female, while 45.3% are male. This indicates a slight overrepresentation of females in the survey compared to males. The relatively balanced distribution suggests that responses are not significantly skewed toward one gender, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of gender-based trends and perspectives.

```{r}

Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

Discrimination against individuals based on their **sexual orientation and gender identity** remains a significant issue across various societies. The survey categorizes public perceptions of discrimination into six levels: **Very widespread, Fairly widespread, Fairly rare, Very rare, Non-existent (Spontaneous), and Donât know (DK)**. These categories help assess the extent to which individuals recognize discrimination in their respective countries.

The results indicate that **the majority of respondents perceive discrimination as either very or fairly widespread**. This suggests that LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender people, continue to face systemic barriers in social, legal, and professional spheres. A smaller proportion of respondents consider discrimination **fairly rare or very rare**, implying regional differences in attitudes and legal frameworks that either mitigate or reinforce these experiences.

Interestingly, **very few respondents believe that discrimination does not exist at all**, reinforcing the notion that discrimination is a recognized issue, even in more progressive societies. Additionally, the presence of responses in the **"Donât know" category** indicates a lack of awareness or reluctance to express opinions on this subject, which may be influenced by cultural sensitivities or personal biases.

Comparing discrimination against transgender individuals and sexual orientation-based discrimination, **the perception of discrimination against transgender individuals appears slightly higher**. This may stem from the additional social and legal barriers that transgender individuals face, including restrictions on gender recognition, healthcare access, and workplace inclusion.

These findings emphasize the need for **stronger anti-discrimination policies, legal protections, and social awareness initiatives** to ensure the fair treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals. Addressing these issues through education and policy reforms is crucial for fostering inclusive societies that respect and uphold the rights of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

Political Interest

The Political Interest Index categorizes respondents into four levels: Strong (1), Medium (2), Low (3), and Not at all (4). The distribution shows that the majority of respondents fall into the Medium category, suggesting that most individuals engage with politics to some degree but do not exhibit strong interest. Meanwhile, fewer respondents report either strong political interest or no interest at all. This suggests a general trend toward moderate political engagement among participants.

The distribution of religious denominations shows that Catholicism is the most dominant religion, followed by Orthodox Christianity and Protestantism, while Non-believers/Agnostics and Atheists also represent a significant portion, indicating a strong secular trend. Muslim groups, including Sunni, Shia, and Other Muslim, are relatively small, suggesting they are a minority in the surveyed population. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and Sikhism, have minimal representation. Additionally, a small percentage of respondents either refused to disclose their religious affiliation or selected âDonât Know,â highlighting potential reluctance or uncertainty regarding religious identity. The data overall reflects a predominantly Christian population with notable secular tendencies and limited religious diversity.

The ordered logistic regression model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing support for transgender rights across different countries while accounting for country-level variations. The model has an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 31415.22 and a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of 31439.70, which are useful for model comparison. The log-likelihood (-15704.61) and deviance (31409.22) indicate the overall fit of the model. With 25,898 residual degrees of freedom, the model effectively utilizes the dataset while maintaining a good balance between complexity and interpretability.

The model incorporates random intercepts for countries (ISO3C), with a standard deviation of 0.94. This suggests that support for transgender rights varies significantly across different European countries. Some countries exhibit stronger support, while others show lower acceptance, emphasizing the importance of regional and cultural differences in shaping attitudes toward transgender rights.

The fixed effects estimate for the intercept is -0.0592, representing the baseline log-odds of supporting transgender rights for the reference category (likely male). The coefficient for gender (0.2910) indicates that women are more likely to support transgender rights compared to men. The positive sign of the coefficient suggests that identifying as female increases the likelihood of expressing support for transgender rights.

The findings demonstrate that gender plays a significant role in shaping attitudes toward transgender rights, with women showing higher levels of support than men. Additionally, there is notable variation in support across countries, indicating that national-level factors contribute to differences in attitudes toward transgender individuals.

```{r}
library(sjPlot)
plot_model(model1, type = "est", show.values = TRUE, title = "Effect of Gender on Support for Transgender Rights")






```

This plot visualizes the effect of gender on support for transgender rights, expressed in odds ratios (OR). The odds ratio of 1.34 that female individuals are 34% more likely to support transgender rights compared to the male group .

The red dot represents the estimated odds ratio, and the confidence interval is likely small, suggesting a statistically significant effect. The presence of next to the value implies a high level of statistical significance (p \< 0.001). Since the odds ratio is above 1, it confirms that gender positively influences support for transgender rights.

The distribution of **education expenditure as a percentage of GDP (edu_exp_pct)** shows that most countries allocate between 4% and 6% of their GDP to education, with some outliers spending more than 7%. This suggests that education is a significant budget priority, but the variation indicates differing national policies and economic capabilities.  

The **GDP distribution** is highly skewed, with most observations concentrated at lower values and a few countries with significantly higher GDPs. This highlights economic disparities among the nations in the dataset, where a small number of countries dominate in terms of economic output.  

When examining **education expenditure across different levels**, lower secondary (lose_exp), upper secondary (upse_exp), and tertiary education (ter_exp) expenditures are concentrated in the 90-97% range. This suggests that most countries prioritize these educational stages, ensuring substantial funding. Primary education (prim_exp) also receives strong investment, with values largely between 85% and 100%, showing consistency in educational priorities.  

On the other hand, **pre-primary education expenditure (preprim_exp)** displays a more dispersed distribution, though most values remain high, indicating recognition of the importance of early childhood education. In contrast, **vocational education expenditure (voc_exp)** exhibits a more varied pattern, with peaks at both 75% and 100%, suggesting that while some countries emphasize vocational training, others invest less in this area.  

Overall, the distributions illustrate a global trend of strong financial commitment to general education, with some variations in economic capacity and prioritization of specific educational stages.



### **Health Variables**

```{r}

health_vars_data <-   final_data[,c("psychological.care", "psychiatric.care", 
         "breast.augmentation", "electrolysis...laser.hair.removal", 
         "facial.feminisation.surgery", "hrt..oestrogen.", 
         "hrt..testosterone.", "hysterectomy", "mastectomy", 
         "metoidioplasty", "orchiectomy", "ovariectomy..aka.oopherectomy.", 
         "phalloplasty", "tracheal.shave", "vaginoplasty", "vocal.training")]


health_vars_long <-health_vars_data|> pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value")
  
ggplot(health_vars_long, aes(x = Value, fill = Variable)) +
  geom_bar(bins = 25, alpha = 0.7, color = "black", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), oob = scales::squish) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Density Distribution of Health Service Variables" , x = "Value", y = "Frequency")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold"),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"))
  

```
The distribution of health service variables highlights varying levels of access and demand for different medical interventions. **Hormone replacement therapies (HRT)** for both **testosterone and oestrogen** appear to be widely utilized, with most values concentrated around 1, suggesting high accessibility or demand. Similarly, **psychological and psychiatric care** also show a high density at the lower values, indicating that these services are commonly accessed.  

Among surgical procedures, **breast augmentation, electrolysis (laser hair removal), facial feminization surgery, and vocal training** show a skewed distribution towards lower values, suggesting that while some individuals access these services, they may not be as widely available or utilized. In contrast, more invasive procedures such as **hysterectomy, mastectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, and phalloplasty** exhibit a more spread-out distribution, possibly reflecting differences in medical eligibility, personal choice, or systemic barriers to access.  

Lastly, **tracheal shave and vaginoplasty** follow similar patterns, with most density at the lower end, indicating that while these procedures are available, fewer individuals access them compared to psychological or hormonal treatments. Overall, the distribution suggests a tiered access to gender-affirming care, where non-surgical and hormonal interventions are more frequently used than complex surgical procedures.



## **Law Variables**

```{r}


legal_vars_data <- final_data[,c(
"nolger", "exist_lgme", "exist_adm", "name_change", "nar_name_change",  "self_det", "nb_recog", "psych_diag", "med_interven", "surg_interven", "steril_req", 
         "div_req", "age_restrict", "lgrp_minors","depath") ]

legal_vars_long <-legal_vars_data|> pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value")


ggplot(legal_vars_long, aes(x = Value, fill = Variable)) +
  geom_bar(bins = 30, alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), oob = scales::squish)+
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Economical Variables ", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold"),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"))
  

 
```
 
The distribution of **legal and medical transition-related variables** reflects significant variations in policy and accessibility across different aspects of gender recognition and intervention.  

Variables such as **self-determination (self_det), name change, and non-binary recognition (nb_recog)** indicate a higher concentration at lower values, suggesting that these aspects of gender identity recognition are not widely accessible or standardized across regions. Similarly, **medical intervention requirements (med_interven) and psychological diagnosis (psych_diag)** show a higher density at the lower end, implying that in many cases, medical or psychiatric evaluation may not be a strict prerequisite for gender recognition.  

On the other hand, **age restrictions (age_restrict), sterilization requirements (steril_req), and surgical intervention mandates (surg_interven)** appear less commonly enforced, as their distributions are more spread out, indicating variability in policy adoption. Additionally, **the existence of legal gender marker options (exist_lgme) and recognition of gender for minors (lgrp_minors)** suggest that while some countries have progressive measures in place, these rights are not universally accessible.  

Overall, the data underscores the uneven distribution of gender recognition policies, where self-identification and name change procedures are more commonly available than more restrictive requirements such as sterilization or mandatory medical interventions.
