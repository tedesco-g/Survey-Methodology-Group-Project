2066,ISCED 1: Primary education,"Programmes at ISCED level 1, or primary education, are typically designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics (i.e. literacy and numeracy) and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge, personal and social development, in preparation for lower secondary education. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. (see ISCED 2011 Manual paragraph 120)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2067,ISCED 2: Lower secondary education,"Programmes at ISCED level 2, or lower secondary education, are typically designed to build on the earning outcomes from ISCED level 1. Usually, the aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon which education systems may then expand further educational  opportunities. Some education systems may already offer vocational education programmes at ISCED level 2 to provide individuals with skills relevant to employment.  Programmes at this level are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum, introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects. Teachers typically have pedagogical training in specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of students may have several teachers with specialised knowledge of the subjects they teach. (see ISCED 2011 Manual, paragraphs 139-140)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2071,ISCED 3: Upper secondary education,"Programmes at ISCED level 3, or upper secondary education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both.  Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at ISCED level 2. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available. Teachers are often highly qualified in the subjects or fields of specialisation they teach, particularly in the higher grades. (see ISCED 2011 Manual, paragraphs 162-163)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2075,ISCED 4: Post-secondary non-tertiary education,"Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning experiences building on secondary education, preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It aims at the individual acquisition of knowledge, skills and competencies lower than the level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education. Programmes at ISCED level 4, or post-secondary non-tertiary education, are typically designed to provide individuals who completed ISCED level 3 with non-tertiary qualifications required for progression to tertiary education or for employment when their ISCED level 3 qualification does not grant such access. For example, graduates from general ISCED level 3 programmes may choose to complete a non-tertiary vocational qualification; or graduates from vocational ISCED level 3 programmes may choose to increase their level of qualifications or specialise further. The content of ISCED level 4 programmes is not sufficiently complex to be regarded as tertiary education, although it is clearly post-secondary. (see ISCED 2011 Manual, paragraph 185)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2182,Secondary education (ISCED 2 and 3),"Secondary education provides learning and educational activities building on primary education and preparing for both first labour market entry as well as post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education. Broadly speaking, secondary education aims at learning at an intermediate level of complexity. ISCED distinguishes lower and upper secondary education.",ISCED 2011,,,,,,,,
3207,ISCED 02: Pre-primary education,"The educational properties of pre-primary education are characterised by interaction with peers and educators, through which children improve their use of language and social skills, start to develop logical and reasoning skills, and talk through their thought processes. They are also introduced to alphabetical and mathematical concepts, and encouraged to explore their surrounding world and environment. Supervised gross motor activities (i.e. physical exercise through games and other activities) and play-based activities can be used as learning opportunities to promote social interactions with peers and to develop skills, autonomy and school readiness.
